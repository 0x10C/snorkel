Snorkel then learns a generative model of this noise&mdash;learning, essentially, which labeling functions are more accurate than others&mdash;and uses this to train a discriminative classifier.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, the idea is that developers can focus on writing labeling functions&mdash;which are just (Python) functions that provide a label for some subset of data points&mdash;and not think about algorithms _or_ features!\r\n\r\n**_Snorkel is very much a work in progress_**, but some people have already begun developing applications with it, and initial feedback has been positive... let us know what you think, and how we can improve it, in the [Issues](https://github.com/HazyResearch/ddlite/issues) section!\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* Data Programming, to appear at NIPS 2016: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723)\r\n* Workshop paper from HILDA 2016 (note Snorkel was previously _DDLite_): [here](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/papers/DDL_HILDA_2016.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\nSee [the Snorkel repository](https://github.com/HazyResearch/snorkel)",
