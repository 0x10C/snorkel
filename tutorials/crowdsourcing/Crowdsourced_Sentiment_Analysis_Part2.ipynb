    "In [Part I](Crowdsourced_Sentiment_Analysis_Part1.ipynb) of the tutorial we saw how `Snorkel's` generative model can be used to resolve conflicts in crowdsourced answers for a sentiment analysis task. In that part we assumed that we have crowd labels for all our tweets. \n",

    "In this second part, we will show how the output of `Snorkel's` generative model can be used to provide the necessary labeled data for training a Logistic Regression model that takes as input a tweet **for which no crowd labels are available** and predicts its sentiment. To emulate the above we split our dataset in two parts: one with tweets for which crowd labels are available and one with tweets for which crowd labels are hidden from Snorkel.\n",
