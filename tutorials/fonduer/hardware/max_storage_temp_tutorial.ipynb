It's just a Python function that accepts a `Candidate` as the input argument and returns `1` if it says the Candidate should be marked as true, `-1` if it says the `Candidate` should be marked as false, and `0` if it doesn't know how to vote and abstains. In practice, many labeling functions are unipolar: it labels only 1s and 0s, or it labels only -1s and 0s.\n",
