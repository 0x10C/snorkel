# Snorkel Tutorials

We currently provide two tutorials to get you started with Snorkel.

### Intro Tutorial

In this tutorial, we go over the basics of Snorkel by
building an application to identify mentions of spouses in a corpus
of news articles. We keep this one well manicured.

### CDR Tutorial

For a more advanced tutorial, check out the CDR tutorial, where
we build an application to extract chemical-disease relations
from academic literature. We check that it runs end-to-end using
automatic testing, but it's also under active development so
you may run into small issues along the way. So it goes with
real-world information extraction!

### `Fonduer` Tutorial

For an advanced tutorial for extracting information from _richly formatted
data_, where entity relations are conveyed jointly via textual, structural,
tabular, and visual expressions (e.g. tables in PDFs/HTML/XML), check out the
`Fonduer` tutorials. In the `hardware` tutorial, we extract maximum storage
temperatures for transistors from their original datasheets. In the `paleo`
tutorial, we extract formation measurements from scientific literature.
